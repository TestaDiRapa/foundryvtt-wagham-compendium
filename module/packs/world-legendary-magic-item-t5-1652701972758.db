In ancient times, nearly all elven noble houses claimed one such blade. Over the centuries, some blades have faded from the world, their magic lost as family lines have become extinct. Other blades have vanished with their bearers during great quests. Thus, only a few of these weapons remain.</p><p>A moonblade passes down from parent to child. The sword chooses its bearer and remains bonded to that person for life. If the bearer dies, another heir can claim the blade. If no worthy heir exists, the sword lies dormant. It functions like a normal longsword until a worthy soul finds it and lays claim to its power.</p><p>A moonblade serves only one master at a time. The attunement process requires a special ritual in the throne room of an elven regent or in a temple dedicated to the elven gods.</p><p>A moonblade won't serve anyone it regards as craven, erratic, corrupt, or at odds with preserving and protecting elvenkind. If the blade rejects you, you make ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws with disadvantage for 24 hours. If the blade accepts you, you become attuned to it and a new rune appears on the blade. You remain attuned to the weapon until you die or the weapon is destroyed.</p><p>A moonblade has one rune on its blade for each master it has served (typically [[/r 1d6 + 1]]). The first rune always grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Each rune beyond the first grants the moon blade an additional property. The DM chooses each property or determines it randomly on the Moon Blade Properties table.</p><table class=\"rd__table  stripe-odd-table\"><caption>Moonblade Properties</caption><thead><tr><th class=\"col-1 text-center\" data-rd-isroller=\"true\">[[/r d100]]</th><th class=\"col-11\" data-rd-isroller=\"false\">Property</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class=\"col-1 text-center\" data-roll-min=\"1\" data-roll-max=\"40\">01-40</td><td class=\"col-11\">Increase the bonus to attack and damage rolls by 1, to a maximum of +3.

A button's effect lasts until you push a different button or until you push the same button again, which causes the rod to revert to its normal form.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>If you press button 1, the rod becomes a @item[flame tongue] as a fiery blade sprouts from the end opposite the rod's flanged head (you choose the type of sword).</p><p>If you press button 2, the rod's flanged head folds down and two crescent-shaped blades spring out, transforming the rod into a magic battleaxe that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.</p><p>If you press button 3, the rod's flanged head folds down, a spear point springs from the rod's tip, and the rod's handle lengthens into a 6-foot haft, transforming the rod into a magic spear that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.</p><p>If you press button 4, the rod transforms into a climbing pole up to 50 feet long, as you specify. In surfaces as hard as granite, a spike at the bottom and three hooks at the top anchor the pole. Horizontal bars 3 inches long fold out from the sides, 1 foot apart, forming a ladder. The pole can bear up to 4,000 pounds. More weight or lack of solid anchoring causes the rod to revert to its normal form.</p><p>If you press button 5, the rod transforms into a handheld battering ram and grants its user a +10 bonus to Strength checks made to break through doors, barricades, and other barriers.</p><p>If you press button 6, the rod assumes or remains in its normal form and indicates magnetic north. (Nothing happens if this function of the rod is used in a location that has no magnetic north.) The rod also gives you knowledge of your approximate depth beneath the ground or your height above it.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"162\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Drain Life.</span></span> <p>When you hit a creature with a melee attack using the rod, you can force the target to make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw.
